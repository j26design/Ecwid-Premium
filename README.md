# Ecwid (Premium)

A public place to request features and report bugs for the Ecwid (Premium) widget built for Adobe Muse.

## Bugs/Features

### Reporting bugs

1. Create a [*New Issue*](https://github.com/j26design/Ecwid-Premium/issues/new?labels=bug) in the *Issues* tab.
2. In the *Labels* panel, click the gear and select the *bug* label from the dropdown.
3. Give your issue a title and add a description *(optional)* and click *Submit new issue*!

#### File uploads
If your website is not live, I will likely need the .muse file to be able to identify bug. In these cases, you can easily upload your [.muse file here](https://www.dropbox.com/request/jTLS8SM5TU547RCjpgRN). I will be the only one that will be able to view the file (other than yourself, obviously).
